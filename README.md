# TSP-using-Local-Search
he Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP): Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city? It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science. Often instead of providing the distances between the pairs directly, the Euclidean co-ordinates of the cities are given. In this assignment you will be solving TSP using local search
